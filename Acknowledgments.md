# Acknowledgements
I have not been alone in creating this library. For their help, suggestions, and support, I would like to thank:

- ~~fxm, for helping with a certain dilemma I encountered while writing the MENU class.~~ The MENU class is now in a stage of development (was part of the beta release), and is not defined within OGL. However, credit will be reassigned once the MENU class is re-released. 
- MrSwiss, for helping me optimise the waitevent() function and helping me with datatypes. 
- And all of you who have suggested improvements and have took your time to look at my library!
