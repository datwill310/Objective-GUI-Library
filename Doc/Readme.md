# About how this Folder Works

This folder contains the latest version of the documentation.

The doc is within the file OGLXX.chm.

The [HelpNDoc](http://www.helpndoc.com/) project file can be found in OGLXX.hnd. The images from the doc can also be found in this folder.

**Notice: documentation etc. has been moved to OGL.old in preparing for 2.1!**
