# OGL
This folder contains the latest version of the OGL. Older versions can be found in OGL.old.

The unlicensed manifest file can also be found here. This manifest file updates the look of your controls. Please read the doc for more information about how this works (under the tutorial Why do my controls look all old?!).

Another manifest file also enables High-DPI awareness. One can find a merged manifest file in the new doc file.
