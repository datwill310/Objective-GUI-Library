# Objective-GUI-Library
An object-oriented, Free BASIC library used to create GUI programs.

# Version 1.1 is Officially Released. (Saturday 26th November, 2016)
Now with support for Unicode and a few other goodies (check out the documentation for more!), hopefully this library is getting closer to becoming more relevant to your programming needs!<br>
For the manifest file and examples, please look at the first version's folder!<br>
Note: the updated Example 4 will not fully work because the Free BASIC dir command does not read filenames in Unicode. Instead a tiny update was made to the fileupdate macro so that the textbox' contents could be read.
