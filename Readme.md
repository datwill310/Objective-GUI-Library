# All Versions of the OGL are Now Released Under the 3-Clause BSD License. (Friday 6th January, 2017)
Please familiarise yourself with the License.md file. All textual files (not including the Doc) will be licensed under the 3-Clause BSD. References will be provided in each file in this repository.<br>
The 2.x series will also be released under this license. The OGL is not dead but is still under major development.
Thanks for your time and support.

# Version 1.1 is Officially Released. (Saturday 26th November, 2016)
Now with support for Unicode and a few other goodies (check out the documentation for more!), hopefully this library is getting closer to becoming more relevant to your programming needs!<br>
For the manifest file and examples, please look at the first version's folder!<br>
**Note**: the updated Example 4 will not fully work because the Free BASIC dir command does not read filenames in Unicode. Instead a tiny update was made to the fileupdate macro so that the textbox' contents could be read: I'm not too fussed about coding a Windows API, fully Unicode version just yet.
