# Aims
The following will be incorporated into the OGL in future versions (in no particular order):
- [x] **Unicode support - This is both a [request](http://www.freebasic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=25207&p=226518) and an aim of the developer, so it has a high level of priority.**
- [ ] A MENU class - Was a part of the beta release, but had to be rewritten from scratch, and therefore is not part of the OGL at this point.
- [ ] Tooltip support - Probably the first CommonControl control which will be incorporated into the OGL due its ease of application.
- [ ] CommonControl support - No CommonControl is yet supported.
- [x] Allowing the CHECKBOX and the CHECKBOX3WAY to become non-automatic - A very small update which can easily be implemented.
- [ ] Context Menu Support - You know: the type of menu that appears if you right click. Could possibly be separate from the MENU class.

# Requests
The following were not aims of the developer, but are requests made by Free BASIC forum members.
- [ ] Making the OGL High-DPI Aware - Request posted by PaulSquires. Will have to research into this area, and therefore this feature may not be implemented very soon.
